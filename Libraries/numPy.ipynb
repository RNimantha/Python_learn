    "### Why Use NumPy?\n",
    "* In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "* NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is NumPy Faster Than Lists?\n",
    "* NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures."
